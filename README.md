Note: 
  I reveived input/assistance from the following resources:
    -ChatGPT to create basic structure of Loops and if statements, and to loop through all worksheets simultaneously
    -Stackoverflow for storing variables within the for-loop and resetting variables before next conditional statement
    -Katreece Hattaway code from week 2 exercises for color formatting
